Summary: Catalyst, Inception, Lateral View, Explode, Struct, Error

Description: Spark 3.0.0.preview2 version has a bug which is not present in 3.0.0.preview version. When using a table with a double lateral view explode on a struct containing arrays, it raises an error with the message "Couldn't find _gen_alias_127#127 in [array_explod#119]". To reproduce the bug, you can use the provided code snippets with a struct type containing subarrays and run the double lateral view explode query. However, if you use an array of array of strings instead of a struct, the query works fine.
