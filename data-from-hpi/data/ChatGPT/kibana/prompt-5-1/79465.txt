Summary: Automated Package Testing
Keywords: Automated, Package, Testing

Description: While QA has long since taken on the burden of testing our packages, it's time that we bring this testing into the repository. Having these CI checks on the PRs not only brings validation and testing to the changes, but it should also assist with manual testing.

What assets are we testing:

deb
RPM
Docker
tar
zip
Keywords: assets, testing, deb, RPM, Docker, tar, zip

Phase 1
Phase 1 will include testing of deb, RPM, and tar archives. All of these installation steps should follow current documentation.
Keywords: Phase 1, testing, deb, RPM, tar, archives, installation, documentation

We need to determine what environment we are going to use. Elasticsearch uses Vagrant, but Docker might also be an option. We need to weigh both of these options.
Keywords: determine, environment, Elasticsearch, Vagrant, Docker, option, weigh

For testing, we need the ability to assert:

Filesystem permissions
Log output, ensuring it's written to /var/log
Successful installation
Kibana successfully starts
Keywords: testing, ability, assert, filesystem permissions, log output, /var/log, successful installation, Kibana, starts

In addition to the tests outlined above, we should also run a subset of functional tests. Running functional tests also ensures that Kibana can run within the recommended CPU and memory recommendations.

Phase 2
In phase 2, we will add support for testing the Docker package.
Keywords: Phase 2, support, testing, Docker, package

Phase 3
In phase 3, we will add support for testing the zip package for Windows.
Keywords: Phase 3, support, testing, zip package, Windows.
