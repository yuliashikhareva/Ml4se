Summary: Allow hidden saved-objects imported/exported 
Keywords: hidden, saved-objects, import/export

Description: Saved-objects can't be imported/exported if they are hidden, which restricts users from using standard SavedObjectsClient and HTTP APIs. Custom clients are being used for saved-objects due to reasons like custom authorization, attribute validation, and encrypted API keys. However, this has drawbacks, and potential solutions include supporting custom logic for import/export or implementing use-case specific import/export UI and API.
